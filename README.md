<Thanking Diary>
  This is an online Thanking Diary for people who want 
  to start recording their daily "thanks to". It is useful for both religiously,
  or for normal use to record one's daily thanks.
  
What does this project do? 
  It allows the user to keep on track of how positively he/she is living his/her life.
  Living with a positive mindset is very important.
  This web will help the user to continuously record one's mind and live with a good energy.

Why is this project useful? 
  I got this idea from an application called "갓피플" which is a bible application.
  Although it was useful to use the Thank message in the app, it was quite inconvenient 
  becuase the app already had so much functions. The "thanking message" function was 
  rather difficult for me to seek from menu and use it daily. For this reason, I decided
  to make a new website solely for this function.

How to get started?
